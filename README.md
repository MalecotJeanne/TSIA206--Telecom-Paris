# TSIA206--Telecom-Paris

This course covers the methodological and theoretical foundations of speech and audio-frequency signal processing, as well as its applications. Speech and music signals are a type of data massively available on the web. Their analysis is an essential step in indexing, which then enables social networking sites to organize and aggregate this content. Speech data also plays a central role in speech analytics and human-machine interaction applications (google voice, siri). Finally, audio-frequency signal processing is currently the subject of numerous developments, most of which affect our daily lives (music, home studio, home cinema).
